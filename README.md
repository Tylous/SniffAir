# SniffAir

SniffAir is an open-source wireless security framework which provides the ability to easily parse passively collected wireless data as well as launch sophisticated wireless attacks. SniffAir takes care of the hassle associated with managing large or multiple pcap files while thoroughly cross-examining and analyzing the traffic, looking for potential security flaws. Along with the prebuilt queries, SniffAir allows users to create custom queries for analyzing the wireless data stored in the backend SQL database. SniffAir is built on the concept of using these queries to extract data for wireless penetration test reports. The data can also be leveraged in setting up sophisticated wireless attacks included in SniffAir as modules.

```

## Begin
-----
First create or load a new or existing workspace using the command ```workspace create <workspace>``` or ```workspace load <workspace>``` command. To view all existing workspaces use the ```workspace list``` command and ```workspace delete <workspace>``` command to delete the desired workspace:
 
```
 >>  [default]# workspace
     Manages workspaces
 Command Option: workspaces [create|list|load|delete]
>>  [default]# workspace create demo
[+]  Workspace demo created
```


Load data into a desired workplace from a pcap file using the command ```offline_capture <the full path to the pcap file>```. To load a series of pcap files use the command ```offline_capture_list <the full path to the file containing the list of pcap name>``` (this file should contain the full patches to each pcap file). Use the ```live_capture <interface name>``` command to capture live wireless traffic using a wireless interface.
 
 ```
 >>  [demo]# offline_capture /root/sniffair/demo.pcapdump
[+] Importing /root/sniffair/demo.pcapdump
\
[+] Completed
[+] Cleaning Up Duplicates
[+] ESSIDs Observed
```
 

## Show Command
-----
The ```show``` command displays the contents of a table, specific information across all tables or the available modules, using the following syntax:

```
 >>  [demo]# show table AP
+------+-----------+-------------------+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+--------+
|   ID | ESSID     | BSSID             | VENDOR                        |   CHAN |   PWR | ENC   | CIPHER   | AUTH   |
|------+-----------+-------------------+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+--------|
|    1 | HoneyPot  | c4:6e:1f:##:##:## | TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO. LTD. |      4 |   -17 | WPA2  | TKIP     | MGT    |
|    2 | Demo      | 80:2a:a8:##:##:## | Ubiquiti Networks Inc.        |     11 |   -19 | WPA2  | CCMP     | PSK    |
|    3 | Demo5ghz  | 82:2a:a8:##:##:## | Unknown                       |     36 |   -27 | WPA2  | CCMP     | PSK    |
|    4 | HoneyPot1 | c4:6e:1f:##:##:## | TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO. LTD. |     36 |   -29 | WPA2  | TKIP     | PSK    |
|    5 | BELL456   | 44:e9:dd:##:##:## | Sagemcom Broadband SAS        |      6 |   -73 | WPA2  | CCMP     | PSK    |
+------+-----------+-------------------+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+--------+
 >>  [demo]# show SSIDS
---------
HoneyPot
Demo
HoneyPot1
BELL456

Demo5ghz
---------

```

The ```query``` command can be used to display a unique set of data based on the parememters specificed. The ```query``` command uses sql syntax.

## Inscope
-----
the ```inscope <SSID>``` command can be used to add a SSID to the inscope tables, loading all related data to the inscope_AP, inscope_proberequests and inscope_proberesponses tables. To view a summary of all inscope SSIDS run the ```SSID_Info``` command.

## Modules
-----

Modules can be used to analyze the data contained in the workspaces or perform offensive wireless attacks using the ```use <module name>``` command. For some modules additional variables may need to be set. They can be set using the set command ```set <variable name> <variable value>```:
```
 >>  [demo]# show modules

 >>  [demo]# 
 >>  [demo]# use Captive Portal
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# info
Globally Set Varibles
=====================
 Module: Captive Portal
 Interface: 
 SSID: 
 Channel: 
 Template: Cisco (More to be added soon)
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# set Interface wlan0
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# set SSID demo
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# set Channel 1
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# info
Globally Set Varibles
=====================
 Module: Captive Portal
 Interface: wlan0
 SSID: demo
 Channel: 1
 Template: Cisco (More to be added soon)
 >>  [demo][Captive Portal]# 
```
Once all varibles are set, then execute the ```exploit``` or ```run``` command to run the desired attack.


## Export
-----
To export all information stored in a workspaceâ€™s tables using the ```Exporter``` module and setting the desired path.
